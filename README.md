## Installation

### GTSAM

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:davidswords/libgtsam.git
$ cd libgtsam
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ sudo make install
```

### HW3

Install graphviz if not already installed. Graphviz is a command-line tool for visualizing graphs.

```
$ sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

## Related documentation

  - The GTSAM tutorial should be of great help for this HW:

  - For the part II of the HW, you may want to consult the format of the SLAM datasets:

  http://www.lucacarlone.com/index.php/resources/datasets

  We are using the dataset named M3500, with file format 'g2o', which is a Manhattan-type map with 3500 poses or 'vertices', and more than 4500 factors or 'edges'.

## Homework

This HW3 has two parts: the first part is a small exercise to get in contact with GTSAM. The second part is a full SLAM problem.

See 'Compiling and executing' below for further instructions.

### Part I: build a simple SLAM problem and solve it. 

To make this part, you need to get inspiration from Listing 1 and Listing 2 in the GTSAM tutorial text.

  - Build a prior for the first state:
    - prior: `[x,y,th] = [0,0,0], sigmas = [0.2,0.2,0.1]`
  - Build a chain of odometry steps between consecutive states:
    - step 1: `[dx,dy,dth] = [2.0, 0.0, 0.0 ]; sigmas = [0.3,0.3,0.1]`
    - step 2: `[dx,dy,dth] = [2.0, 0.0, pi/2]`
    - step 3: `[dx,dy,dth] = [2.0, 0.0, pi/2]`
    - step 4: `[dx,dy,dth] = [2.0, 0.0, pi/2]`
  - Set the initial pose states of the 5 nodes to somewhat wrong values:
    - pose 1: `[x,y,th] = [0.5, 0.0,  0.2]`
    - pose 2: `[x,y,th] = [2.3, 0.1, -0.2]`
    - pose 3: `[x,y,th] = [4.1, 0.1,  1.6]`
    - pose 4: `[x,y,th] = [4.0, 2.0,  3.1]`
    - pose 5: `[x,y,th] = [2.1, 2.1, -1.5]`
  - Solve the resulting graph.
  - Visualize it.
  - Compute the marginal covariances of each node
  - Add a loop closure to the graph, between nodes 2 and 5:
    - loop: `[dx,dy,dth] = [0.98, -0.06, 1,6]; sigmas = [0.3,0.3,0.1]`
  - Solve it again.
  - Visualize it. 
  - Compute the marginal covariances of each node
  - Compare the covariances with the case of no loop closure.
  
### Part II: build a complete SLAM problem

To make this part, you need to extend the work on part I by reading a large dataset containing information about the nodes and edges of a factor graph.

  - Read the dataset
  - Parse it and build the graph:
    - For each node, initialize the state
    - For each edge, create a odometry factor
  - save the graph of the problem prior to solving: file `<input_name>.dot`
  - visualize the problem prior to solving, 
    - In the linux terminal, type 
    ```
    neato -x -Gorientation=landscape -Nfontsize=30 -Tpdf <input_name>.dot > <output_name>.pdf
    ``` 
    and visualize the document. 
  - Compare and comment the results.
